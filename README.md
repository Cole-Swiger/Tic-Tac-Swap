# Tic-Tac-Swap
Game built in Unity based on the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
In Tic-Tac-Swap, players get an additional move option that allows them to swap the pieces on the board.
For example, if there is a circle in the top-left corner and a triangle in the middle square, a player can choose to swap those pieces instead of placing one.

Once two pieces have been swapped, they cannot be swapped again. This new move also allows a player to stop a three-in-a-row from the other player after the play has been made. This means that the game doesn't end immediately on three-in-a-row.
